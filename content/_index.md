I am a **PhD student** in the [AISE](https://malihehizadi.github.io/people/) lab at [Delft University of Technology](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/). My research explores the intersection of **Large Language Models** and **Software Engineering**, with a focus on developing **reliable evaluation techniques** for Large Language Models for **coding tasks**. Additionally, I'm interested in expanding my knowledge of **AI Agents** and how they can be used to improve Software Engineering practices.
